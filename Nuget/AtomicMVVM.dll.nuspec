    <description>A supremely lightweight MVVM framework for WPF projects.</description>
    <releaseNotes>1.0.5 - Added support for non-default view constructors which allows for data passing. Added support for global app commands.
1.0.4 - Building for .NET 4 client profile now (rather than 4.5 as was doing).
1.0.3 - Doesn't help if I don't include the updated assembly. So this is 1.0.2 proper.
1.0.2 - Updated project to be the bitbucket site. Helps if I make classes public (doh). Added trigger property logic.
1.0.1 - Fixed bug in the type location.
1.0.0 - First release.</releaseNotes>
