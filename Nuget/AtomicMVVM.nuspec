    <summary>A supremely lightweight MVVM framework for WPF &amp; Metro projects.</summary>
    <releaseNotes>NOTE: This version has breaking changes from v4.
Note: .NET version 4, Silverlight 4 &amp; Windows Phone are no longer supported.
Added view state support for the Metro apps into the framework.
Added non-generic versions of Start &amp; ChangeView methods.
Added an AfterStartEvent which allows applications to run when everything is ready - UI, BS etc...
Switched the NotifyPropertChanged methods to use the new callerinfo stuff.
Added IntelliSense documentation.
Added an attached property which can be used to bind controls on rather than the name.
Added CoreDataLight which gives a lighter version for just INotifyPropertyChanged.
Added the ability to state if a call is made async or sync for NotifyPropertyChanged using an attribute.
Added IWhenDataBound which allows views to know when the bootstrapper binds the VM to them.
Many internal cleanups and fixes.

    <description>The goal of AtomicMVVM is to allow developers to work with MVVM in their XAML based solutions (XPF, WinRT) with minimal effort while not getting in the way of the code. It requires .NET 4.5 or higher. The design goals of AtomicMVVM are (in order): simple over feature rich, unobtrusive over less code and convention over configuration.</description>
