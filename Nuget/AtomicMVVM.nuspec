    <summary>A supremely lightweight MVVM framework for WPF, Silverlight, Windows Phone &amp; Metro projects.</summary>
    <releaseNotes>NOTE: This version has breaking changes from v3.
The bootstrapper is no longer generic, rather the generic aspects have been moved to the Start method.
  This enables the bootstrapper to be used more easily (internally &amp; externally).
  This also enables future ideas such as switching out the shell.
Previously internal fields for current shell, view &amp; view model are now public properties.
  This enables the bootstrapper to be better unit tested itself &amp; used in unit testing.
  Allows for some dynamic logic in view models.
CoreData now has a bootstrapper property
  When a view model is created the property is set to the creating bootstrapper allowing for the view model to be able to interact with the bootstrapper without needing global variables etc...
  This was really only enabled with the removal of the generic aspects (above).
Added the StubShell
  This is a simple shell implementation for use in unit tests.
Updated all the Metro aspects to work with Windows 8 Release Candidate
  This was really just two things, removing an unused namespace &amp; changing to the new async invoker.

    <description>The goal of AtomicMVVM is to allow developers to work with MVVM in their XAML based solutions (XPF, Silverlight, Windows Phone, WinRT) with minimal effort while not getting in the way of the code. It requires .NET 4 or higher. The design goals of AtomicMVVM are (in order): simple over feature rich, unobtrusive over less code and convention over configuration.</description>
